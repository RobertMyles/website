I'm Robert McDonnell and I live in Brazil, in the hustle and bustle of São Paulo. I studied Fine Art (in [NCAD](http://www.ncad.ie/) in Dublin, Ireland), International Relations & Political Science (in [DCU](http://www.dcu.ie/)), and I did my PhD in International Relations in the University of São Paulo. My academic work has so far focused on Bayesian item-response models of legislative voting. Currently, I produce some research for the [Getúlio Vargas Foundation](http://portal.fgv.br/en), I'm developing some R packages, I give classes and courses on R and data analysis for [IBPAD](http://www.ibpad.com.br/), and I do some freelance R consultancy.   

You can find my work on [Github](https://github.com/RobertMyles), or have a look at my [LinkedIn](https://br.linkedin.com/in/robert-mcdonnell-7475b320) or my [CV](http://robertmyles.github.io/cv/).
