## <i class="fa fa-history"></i> Professional History

### Data Scientist, Avanade, São Paulo
- 08/2017 — Present

I currently work for Avanade in the São Paulo office. So far, I've been working on integrating R and Python into larger applications and creating business analytics solutions.  

### São Paulo City Council
- 03/2017 — 07/2017
- São Paulo
- Position: Director of DIPROJ; Data Science & Analytics Administration

In the *Secretaria da Fazenda*, I headed a team responsible for making accurate forecasts of data on public spending. Part of my job was also modernizing the way the department does analysis. To do that, I gave an in-house R course and built a Shiny application for the department (part of an internal R package that I wrote), along with the production of semi-automated reports. It was an interesting experience being at the heart of politics in one of the biggest cities in the world, without a doubt. I learned how much of the job was actually about something very simple: managing relationships.   

### Instituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Análise de Dados ([IBPAD](http://www.ibpad.com.br/))
- 08/2016 – present
- Various locations throughout Brazil
- Position: Course Tutor

 I give private classes, in-company courses and public courses on the statistical programming language R. I am responsible for designing and giving the classes, and I also contribute to the blog of the Institute. The topics covered in the public course include: an introduction to statistics; obtaining, cleaning and tidying data; data analysis and modelling; producing plots and interactive visualizations; producing high-quality documents and web pages in RStudio. I was also part of a 2-man team that designed and implemented a successful in-company course for the airline company Gol, which included an introduction to R, statistics in R, and machine learning in R. In my private classes, I have helped clients to implement genetic algorithms from scratch in R for analysis of financial data, among other things.

### Freelance R Consultant

I've helped people with projects ranging from their academic work to scraping information from social media sites, text analysis to statistics, in areas ranging from finance to communication and to legislative studies.

### [Fundação Getúlio Vargas](http://cpdoc.fgv.br/en/about)
- 08/2016 – present
- São Paulo, Brazil
- Position: researcher

I write case studies for FGV, to be used as teaching materials in their post-graduate courses, on topics ranging from Brexit to the embargo of Cuba. Apart from that, I do some data science work (web-scraping, organizing & cleaning data and statistical analyses) for some researchers involved with the Centre for International Relations.

### [Centre for the Study of International Negotiations (CAENI)](http://www.caeni.com.br/)
- 03/2012 – 07/2016
- University of São Paulo, Brazil
- Position: researcher

I was a researcher at CAENI in USP during my PhD, and I was involved in seminars and study groups, as well as with the production of research. I also gave courses during my time there, on running Bayesian statistical models and doing analysis in the statistical programming language R.

## <i class="fa fa-crosshairs"></i> Professional Summary

I believe that my skills and background give me some unique advantages in the field of data analysis. I have found that my artistic background is very useful when it comes to visualizing data and the results of research. Similarly, my ability to speak well publicly, as demonstrated for example in the pieces theatre which I wrote and performed during my undergraduate degree, has been a great asset to me when speaking publicly about the work I’ve done.
I have a very high level of writing ability, as I have shown in academic work that I have published, a capability that has allowed me to produce high-quality studies that are enjoyable to read for experts and non-experts alike. My love of data wrangling and analysis, and programming in general, allows me to bring all these abilities together in a modern way, in what I believe is a valuable package for data analysis in any context.
