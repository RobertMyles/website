<p>I was just about to update R a while ago when I thought to myself that there must be a way to do this inside of R (RStudio, I mean). A quick Google search brought me to the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/installr/">installr</a> package. Very nice, but I use a Mac. Hmmm…<br />
A bit more searching and I found Andrea Cirillo’s <a href="https://github.com/AndreaCirilloAC/updateR">updateR</a> package, which was made for OS X, fantastic. I tried it out, and although it worked great, I still had to leave RStudio to check to see if the latest version installed. I really liked Andrea’s package, so I thought I would suggest a few changes to him.</p>
<p>Basically, now the function prints out a few more informative messages and makes it unnecessary to have to leave RStudio. I’ve used it since then and all works great, so next time you need to update R on your Mac, you can do it from inside Rstudio ;-)</p>
