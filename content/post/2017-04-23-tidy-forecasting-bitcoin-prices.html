<p>Cryptocurrencies are becoming an interest of mine, since I’ve got friends who talk about them all the time. So I thought it might be interesting to have a look at a time series of BitCoin, and use the opportunity to do some tidyverse-style time series analysis, in the spirit of <a href="http://unconj.ca/blog/forecasting-yyz-passengers-in-the-tidyverse.html">this</a> great post. The data are availbale from <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/price/" class="uri">http://www.coindesk.com/price/</a>. Click on <code>Select All &gt; Export</code> to download the data.</p>
<p>First, we import the csv and turn it into a ts object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bit &lt;- read_csv(&quot;../../data/coindesk-bpi-USD-close_data-2010-07-17_2017-04-23.csv&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(!is.na(Date))

bitcoin &lt;- ts(data = bit$`Close Price`, start = c(2010, 7, 7), end = c(2017, 4, 7))</code></pre>
<p>We can have a look at the raw data. You could do this by plotting the time series (ts) object using <code>forecast::plot()</code>, but here I’ll use ggplot2 and the raw data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(bit, aes(x = Date, y = `Close Price`)) +
  geom_line(colour = &quot;dodgerblue3&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a volatile time series. There’s a definite trend and no apparent seasonality.</p>
