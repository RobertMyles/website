<p>After seeing Nadieh Bremer’s great <a href="http://www.datasketch.es/april/code/nadieh/">Breathing Earth</a> infographic, I thought it would be cool to recreate it in R, as you do. Then I saw that it was made from lots of tif files…hmmm. I did some work with those before, ain’t doin it again voluntarily, no thanks.</p>
<p>So then I started thinking about something else that would be (kind of) similar and interesting. I saw the <a href="https://github.com/edzer/sfr">sf</a> package and its interesting <code>geom_sf()</code> recently, and so I thought it would be a nice opportunity to try that out. Given we started with ‘breathing’ Earth, the natural next step was to think of ‘inhaling’ Earth! A quick download of some cannabis data from <a href="https://data.unodc.org/?lf=1&amp;lng=en">here</a> and we’re (almost) ready to go, just some cleaning, tidying and merging with the geometry data from the <a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rnaturalearth">rnaturalearth</a> package.</p>

<p>That works! Nice. Ok, it’s pretty simple, but given the hellish wrangling involved with some spatial polygon sets and administrative unit geographical data, I’m really impressed with how easy <code>geom_sf()</code> was to use.</p>
