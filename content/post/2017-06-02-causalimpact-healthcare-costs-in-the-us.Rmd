[This](https://mises.org/blog/how-government-regulations-made-healthcare-so-expensive) article by Mike Holly on Mises.org interested me. I wasn't aware of the history of healthcare costs in the US, and it's quite surprising, especially the take-off in costs after the 1960s. Holly's argument is that the "U.S. 'health care cost crisis' didnâ€™t start until 1965. The government increased demand with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid while restricting the supply of doctors and hospitals." In fact, I was quite impressed with this graph:

```{r, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
x <- c("rvest", "dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "magrittr", "lubridate")
lapply(x, require, character.only = TRUE) 
```

I've wanted an excuse to use Google's [CausalImpact](https://github.com/google/CausalImpact) package for a while now, so let's give it a shot using these data. The Consumer Price Index we can grab quickly, since it's widely available:  

```{r}
url <- "http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/"

cpi <- read_html(url) %>% 
  html_node("table") %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  dplyr::select(-X14:-X16) %>% 
  filter(X1 != "Year") %>% 
  set_colnames(c("Year", "m01", "m02", "m03", "m04", "m05", "m06", 
                 "m07", "m08", "m09", "m10", "m11", "m12")) %>% 
  mutate_all(as.numeric) %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  gather(Month, Value, m01:m12) %>% 
  mutate(Day = "01",
         Month = gsub("m", "", Month),
         Date = paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = "-"),
         Date = parse_date_time(Date, "Ymd")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Date, Value) %>% arrange(Date) %>% filter(!is.na(Value)) #%>% 
  #mutate(Value = (Value - mean(Value))/sd(Value))

ggplot(cpi, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +
  geom_line(colour = "dodgerblue") +
  theme_minimal() + ylab(NULL) + xlab(NULL)

```



```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}

# url <- "https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet"
# 
# 
# 
# params <- list(
#   request_action = "get_data",
#   reformat = "true",
#   from_results_page = "true",
#   from_year = "1935",
#   to_year = "2009",
#   Go.x = "4",
#   Go.y = "6",
#   initial_request = "false",
#   data_tool = "latest_numbers",
#   series_id = "CUUR0000SAM",
#   years_option = "specific_years",
#   output_view = "pct_12mths||||",
#   original_include_graphs = "true",
#   original_output_view = "pct_12mths||||",
#   nnualAveragesRequested = "false",
#   download_xlsx = "Download as an Excel File")



library(readr)
med <- read_csv("C:/Users/d840118/Downloads/CPIMEDSL.csv") %>% 
  mutate(DATE = parse_date_time(DATE, "Ymd"))
                  


#medical <- httr::POST(url, body = params, encode = 'form') #%>% httr::content("parsed")
#head(read.csv(textConnection(as.character(medical))))
```

Downloading the data for Medical costs from the US [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet) let us plot the two side-by-side:  

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = dplyr::filter(cpi, Date >= "1947-01-01"), aes(x = Date, y = Value),
            colour = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_line(data = med, aes(x = DATE, y = CPIMEDSL), colour = "firebrick") +
  theme_minimal() + ylab(NULL) + xlab(NULL) +
  annotate("text", label = "Medical care price index", y = 300, 
           x = as.POSIXct("1993-01-01"), colour = "firebrick") +
  annotate("text", label = "Consumer price index", y = 110, 
           x = as.POSIXct("1999-01-01"), colour = "dodgerblue")

```


Certainly looks similar, although not quite as dramatic (slightly different take-off points too, in the split). And Holly seems to have divided the numbers on the y-axis by 10 or something like that. Nonetheless, it looks like we're dealing with the same data. So now let's impact that thang.  



```{r, message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

library(CausalImpact)

cpi <- cpi %>% 
  filter(Date >= "1947-01-01") %>% 
  rename(cpi = Value)

med <- med %>%
  rename(Date = DATE, med = CPIMEDSL)

series <- full_join(med, cpi) %>% filter(!is.na(cpi))

pre_period <- c(1, 449)
post_period <- c(450, 843)

impact <- CausalImpact(series[, 2:3], pre_period, post_period)
plot(impact)

```


I won't dare attempt to draw *causal* conclusions (my DAG/Judea Pearl-loving friends would never forgive me). I'll just say "interesting".  

`CausalImpact` also has a summary function which prints out a report! Let's have a look:  

```{r}
summary(impact, "report")
```



Ooh, very fancy.
