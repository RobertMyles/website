<p><em>This post got lost mysteriously when I transitioned to Netlify – just reposting. It was originally from June 2017.</em></p>
<p>I’m not too sure that the <a href="http://reports.weforum.org/human-capital-report-2016/rankings/">Human Capital Index</a> is a reliable measure of what it’s supposed to measure, but I’m convinced by <a href="http://deirdremccloskey.org/">Deirdre McCloskey’s</a> eloquent arguments that it is Human Capital, or ingenuity, in less dry terms, that has made the modern world (in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/upshot/the-formula-for-a-richer-world-equality-liberty-justice.html">conjunction with freedom and some basic legal structures</a>). However, all that interesting talk aside, there are now quite a few new ways to make maps in R. The <a href="https://github.com/edzer/sfr">sf</a> package has synced up with the dev version of ggplot2 to produce <code>geom_sf()</code>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-nutshell.html">tmaps</a> brings some cool themes to ggplot maps and <a href="https://leonawicz.github.io/mapmate/mapmate.html">mapmate</a> has been used to produce some stunning visualizations. Hence, I thought I’d use the HCI to check these out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rvest)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

hci &lt;- read_html(&quot;http://reports.weforum.org/human-capital-report-2016/rankings/&quot;) %&gt;%
  html_node(&quot;table&quot;) %&gt;% html_table() %&gt;% 
  rename(country = Economy, rank = `Overall Rank`, human_capital = `Overall Score`) %&gt;% 
  mutate(country = recode(country, 
                          &#39;Russian Federation&#39; = &#39;Russia&#39;,
                          &#39;United Kingdom&#39; = &#39;UK&#39;,
                          &#39;United States&#39; = &#39;USA&#39;,
                          &#39;Korea, Rep.&#39; = &#39;South Korea&#39;,
                          &#39;Kyrgyz Republic&#39; = &#39;Kyrgyzstan&#39;,
                          &#39;Slovak Republic&#39; = &#39;Slovakia&#39;,
                          &#39;Macedonia, FYR&#39; = &#39;Macedonia&#39;,
                          &#39;Iran, Islamic Rep.&#39; = &#39;Iran&#39;,
                          &#39;Trinidad and Tobago&#39; = &#39;Trinidad&#39;,
                          &#39;Lao PDR&#39; = &#39;Laos&#39;,
                          &#39;CÙte d’Ivoire&#39; = &#39;Ivory Coast&#39;))</code></pre>
<p>I used to make maps in ggplot style with shapefiles, fortify and so on. The upside is that there are lots of shapefiles <a href="http://www.gadm.org/country">available</a>, but the downsides are that the dataframes you end up with are usually pretty big. There’s a <code>map_data()</code> function in the ggplot2 package that grabs some polygon data. The vanilla map we can make with these functions looks like this (with <code>theme_minimal()</code> to prettify things):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>globe &lt;- map_data(&quot;world&quot;) %&gt;% rename(country = region)


world &lt;- left_join(globe, hci)


ggplot(data = world, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = human_capital)) + 
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-27-human-capital-index-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Not bad. You can mess around with the projections using <code>coord_map()</code>, but it still feels a long way from Mike Bostock’s <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock">amazing d3 maps</a> (I know, d3 is more geared towards presentation. Still…). Let’s use <code>coord_map()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = world, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = human_capital)) +
  coord_map(projection = &quot;gilbert&quot;) + 
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-27-human-capital-index-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = world, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = human_capital)) +
  coord_map(projection = &quot;azequidistant&quot;) + 
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-27-human-capital-index-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>So let’s try the sf method. I’m getting a dataset of world ‘geometry’ coordinates (a list-column in the sf dataframe) from the rnaturalearth package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rnaturalearth)
library(sf)

countries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;) %&gt;% 
  rename(country = sovereignt) %&gt;% 
  select(country, geometry) %&gt;% 
  mutate(country = recode(country, 
                          &quot;United States of America&quot; = &quot;USA&quot;,
                          &quot;United Kingdom&quot; = &quot;UK&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  left_join(hci)

ggplot(countries) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill = human_capital), size = 0.2) +
  theme_minimal()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-27-human-capital-index-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The sf map doesn’t look massively better than that created with <code>geom_polygon()</code> (it’s much more in proportion, as I haven’t changed figure sizes in this RMarkdown document), although the process feels more intuitive to me. The dataframe feels ‘tidier’, as it still has the country as the unit of analysis – in other words, the dataframe we’re using has 177 rows, as opposed to tens of thousands. Let’s try some themes with tmap.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tmap)

tm_shape(countries) +
    tm_polygons(&quot;human_capital&quot;, title=&quot;Human Capital Index&quot;) +
tm_format_World() +
tm_style_grey()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-09-27-human-capital-index-maps_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Ooh, that’s nice. The theme actually makes it easier to see what’s going on: the difference between Canada &amp; the US was not so apparent before. (Canada’s score is 81.95 as opposed to 78.86 for the US…so precise, these numbers.)</p>
<p>So in terms of how things <em>look</em>, using this basic code, tmap comes out well. I don’t really like its syntax though, it reminds me of <code>qplot()</code>. I prefer the full <code>ggplot()</code> approach myself.</p>
