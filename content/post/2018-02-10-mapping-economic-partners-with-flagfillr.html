<p>üá®üá® üá®üáΩ üáµüáπ üá©üá¥ üá´üá≤ üá∞üá∑ Recently I wrote a little package for R called flagfillr (you can read more details <a href="https://github.com/RobertMyles/flagfillr">here</a>). One of the main reasons I made this is because I had seen a few maps of economic partners, for example this one, from <a href="http://drunkeynesian.blogspot.com.br/2017/11/o-que-os-estados-brasileiros-exportam.html">here</a>:</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p>These types of maps (some more <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-state-import-export-international-trade-partner-map-2017-11">here</a>, of the US) are interesting visual summaries, but they look a little <em>Excel</em> to me (sorry, whoever made it!). I thought I could spice them up with flags, cos hey, who doesn‚Äôt like cool flags (like Bhutan, üáßüáπ, awesome!)</p>
<div id="enter-flagfillr" class="section level2">
<h2>Enter <code>flagfillr</code></h2>
<p>With flagfillr, the above map can easily be created. Once you have a data.frame of the data (here I refer to it as <code>DF</code>), you can do it with one line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>flagfillr::flag_fillr_data(data = DF, country = &quot;Brazil&quot;, resolution = &quot;large&quot;,
                           size = &quot;250&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Which, if your data corresponds to the map above, will give you this:</p>

<p>So how can you do this for another country? Let‚Äôs take the example of Australia, from data available <a href="http://dfat.gov.au/trade/resources/trade-at-a-glance/Pages/goods-by-state.aspx">here</a>. First of all, we‚Äôll need to put our data into a dataframe, preferably with columns named <code>country</code>, <code>state</code> and <code>partner</code>, just to keep things simple. Simple is good. I‚Äôll use <code>dplyr</code> here (don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôll have to install flagfillr, see <a href="https://github.com/RobertMyles/flagfillr">here</a>). Since Australia‚Äôs main trade partners by state are basically China and Japan, let‚Äôs choose the <em>third</em> biggest trade partner by state, just to keep things interesting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(flagfillr) 
library(plotly)

oz &lt;- tibble(
  country = &quot;Australia&quot;,
  state = c(&quot;Northern Territory&quot;, &quot;Western Australia&quot;, &quot;New South Wales&quot;,
            &quot;South Australia&quot;, &quot;Victoria&quot;, &quot;Queensland&quot;, &quot;Tasmania&quot;,
            &quot;Australian Capital Territory&quot;),
  partner = c(&quot;India&quot;, &quot;United Kingdom&quot;, &quot;South Korea&quot;, &quot;Malaysia&quot;, &quot;New Zealand&quot;,
              &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Malaysia&quot;, &quot;Malaysia&quot;)
)

flag_fillr_data(oz, country = &quot;Australia&quot;, type = &quot;state&quot;, size = &quot;250&quot;,
                partner_col = oz$partner, state_col = oz$state)</code></pre>

<p>It‚Äôs not surprising that we see these countries here (the principal partners are China, Japan and India). Indeed, for many countries, the main economic partners are not a surprise. Let‚Äôs take a look at the mainland United States. We can recreate these plots with flagfillr (for more detailed data see <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/index.html">here</a>), and make them a little prettier (they come from <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/us-state-import-export-international-trade-partner-map-2017-11">here</a>).</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>First, let‚Äôs make the data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>states &lt;- state.name
imports &lt;- tibble(
  state = states,
  partner = NA_character_
) %&gt;% 
  mutate(partner = case_when(
    state %in% c(&quot;Oregon&quot;, &quot;Indiana&quot;) ~ &quot;Ireland&quot;,
    state == &quot;Louisiana&quot; ~ &quot;Saudi Arabia&quot;,
    state == &quot;Alabama&quot; ~ &quot;South Korea&quot;,
    state %in% c(&quot;South Carolina&quot;, &quot;Maryland&quot;, &quot;Rhode Island&quot;) ~ &quot;Germany&quot;,
    state == &quot;Delaware&quot; ~ &quot;United Kingdom&quot;,
    state %in% c(&quot;Texas&quot;, &quot;Arizona&quot;, &quot;Utah&quot;) ~ &quot;Mexico&quot;,
    state %in% c(&quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Montana&quot;, &quot;Wyoming&quot;, &quot;Colorado&quot;, &quot;North Dakota&quot;, 
                 &quot;South Dakota&quot;, &quot;Iowa&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, &quot;West Virginia&quot;, &quot;Maine&quot;,
                 &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, &quot;Vermont&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, &quot;Connecticut&quot;) ~&quot;Canada&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;China&quot;
  ))


flag_fillr_data(imports, country = &quot;United States&quot;, type = &quot;state&quot;, size = &quot;250&quot;,
                partner_col = imports$partner, state_col = imports$state)</code></pre>

<p>Maybe that‚Äôs a slightly disturbing vision to some people haha! I like to think it‚Äôs a nice reminder of how intertwined our world is. And some surprises in there‚Ä¶Ireland, South Korea, Saudi Arabia. Seems like Ireland exports tech <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/wy.html">products</a> to Oregon, while Louisiana imports ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì oil from Saudi Arabia. How about the countries that these states most export to?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>exports &lt;- tibble(
  state = states,
  partner = NA_character_
) %&gt;% 
  mutate(partner = case_when(
    state %in% c(&quot;Oregon&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Louisiana&quot;, &quot;South Carolina&quot;) ~ &quot;China&quot;,
    state == &quot;Nevada&quot; ~ &quot;Switzerland&quot;,
    state %in% c(&quot;Utah&quot;, &quot;Delaware&quot;) ~ &quot;United Kingdom&quot;,
    state %in% c(&quot;Wyoming&quot;, &quot;Florida&quot;) ~ &quot;Brazil&quot;,
    state == &quot;Connecticut&quot; ~ &quot;France&quot;,
    state %in% c(&quot;California&quot;, &quot;Texas&quot;, &quot;Arizona&quot;, &quot;New Mexico&quot;, &quot;Nebraska&quot;, 
                 &quot;Kansas&quot;) ~ &quot;Mexico&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;Canada&quot;
  ))


flag_fillr_data(exports, country = &quot;United States&quot;, type = &quot;state&quot;, size = &quot;250&quot;,
                partner_col = exports$partner, state_col = exports$state)</code></pre>

<p>Interesting. What does Utah export to the UK? The ‚Äústate export[s] a broad range of goods, including animal products, aircraft engines, automotive parts, electronics, personal care products, pharmaceuticals, sporting goods, and industrial goods such as valves, drilling tools and fuses‚Äù, <a href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865601174/British-diplomat-lauds-UK-trade-relations-with-Utah.html">supposedly</a>. Brazil and Wyoming also have an interesting relationship, with Wyoming‚Äôs exports being <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/state/data/wy.html">chemicals and the like</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting case that makes for an arresting visualization is the internal trade of European Union. Eurostat presents it to us in this format:<br />

<p>But we can make it prettier! Here I skip the code, but the pattern is the same as the above two plots. You might notice French Guyana sneaking in there ‚Äì it‚Äôs officialy part of France, so it‚Äôs included in the geometry column used for plotting. In the future, it‚Äôd be great to have a clean, easy way to filter it out, but right now that means messing with geometry list-columns, and that‚Äôs a bit messy.</p>

<p>So these are a few examples of the things you can do with flagfillr. Maybe in a future post I‚Äôll map some state-level trade for the countries that have state flags in the package (the Netherlands, for example).</p>
