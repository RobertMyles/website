      <description>This post got lost mysteriously when I transitioned to Netlify – just reposting. It was originally from June 2017.
After seeing Nadieh Bremer’s great Breathing Earth infographic, I thought it would be cool to recreate it in R, as you do. Then I saw that it was made from lots of tif files…hmmm. I did some work with those before, ain’t doin it again voluntarily, no thanks.
So then I started thinking about something else that would be (kind of) similar and interesting.</description>
