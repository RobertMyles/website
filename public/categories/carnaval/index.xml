      <description>I’ve been getting more and more interested in web graphics, particularly d3. All of this of course depends on javascript, a language I don’t know very well. As a way to start learning it, I thought I’d give Shiny a go, as a bridge between R and javascript (I’ve since started a javascript course proper). I’ve been surprised by how simple and powerful Shiny is, although the problems I ran into I wasn’t able to solve.</description>
