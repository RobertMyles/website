      <description>I’ve been working on a project where the client wanted a “cockpit” style dashboard, with meter/gauge/speedometer type things. Even though this wasn’t likely to be implemented in R for the final version, I started thinking about how I could do this with ggplot2, influenced by some code from here. Base R graphics are likely a much better fit for something like this, as Gaston Sanchez’s example shows, but I actually quite like the result with ggplot2.</description>

      <description>I loved this R script from hdugan when I first saw it a while ago. The script makes a 2-page pdf of all the colors available in R, using R. Nice.
The other day, I thought about making a tidyverse version of it, using dplyr to get the data ready and ggplot2 to visualize it. I won’t for a second pretend that this code is as short and tidy as the original, and in fact it may be a good example of when base R can be really useful, but anyway here it is.</description>
