      <description>Since April or so of last year, Iâ€™ve had a personal website on GitHub pages, where I keep this blog and a few other things. Setting it up was at times frustrating, but a good learning process (I especially picked up a lot of Git through that experience). Actually writing, not so good. I picked a theme I liked, all good, but I soon realised that writing as I often do in R Markdown was a little less convenient in the GitHub-flavoured markdown \(\rightarrow\) jekyll \(\rightarrow\) theme \(\rightarrow\) website process.</description>
