After seeing Nadieh Bremer’s great Breathing Earth infographic, I thought it would be cool to recreate it in R, as you do. Then I saw that it was made from lots of tif files…hmmm. I did some work with those before, ain’t doin it again voluntarily, no thanks.
So then I started thinking about something else that would be (kind of) similar and interesting.</description>

This post is a quickie to show how we can visualize the UK election results with just a few lines of R code. (Really, very few). 1
We can load in our usual tidyverse tools, along with a handy little data package, parlitools.
library(readr) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2) library(parlitools) library(sf) Thanks to this R Bloggers post, we have the data (the UK Electoral Commission must have it up by now anyway), so visualizing it is very easy:</description>

I’m not too sure that the Human Capital Index is a reliable measure of what it’s supposed to measure, but I’m convinced by Deirdre McCloskey’s eloquent arguments that it is Human Capital, or ingenuity, in less dry terms, that has made the modern world (in conjunction with freedom and some basic legal structures).</description>
