      <description>I was just about to update R a while ago when I thought to myself that there must be a way to do this inside of R (RStudio, I mean). A quick Google search brought me to the installr package. Very nice, but I use a Mac. Hmmm…
A bit more searching and I found Andrea Cirillo’s updateR package, which was made for OS X, fantastic. I tried it out, and although it worked great, I still had to leave RStudio to check to see if the latest version installed.</description>
