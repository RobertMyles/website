      <description>5/2/2017 Update: it seems something is broken in the scripts to run this analysis. I’ll fix it asap.*The Economist is well known for its graphs and images, and I personally like them a lot. I was doing some work on Brexit when I spied the image above, and thought how much I would like to make something similar. Since my go-to environment is R, and its go-to plotting package ggplot2, I thought I’d try to recreate the image using these tools.</description>
